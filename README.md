## Features

- **Medical Image Analysis**: Supports brain tumor classification and bone fracture detection using pre-trained AI models.
- **Image Format Support**: Handles standard image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG) and DICOM files.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generates structured radiology reports based on image analysis and user-provided details.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user management with account creation, login, and password reset functionality.
- **Rate Limiting**: API request rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.9+
2. PostgreSQL for database management
3. Environment variables for application configuration

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/BenjaminLawani/Pulse.git>
    cd <Pulse>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the database:
    - Update the `DB_URL` environment variable with your PostgreSQL connection string.
    - Create the necessary tables:

      ```python
      from app import Base, engine
      Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
      ```

4. Configure environment variables:

    - `DB_URL`: PostgreSQL database URL
    - `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_FROM`, etc.: Email service credentials
    - `GROQ_API_KEY`: API key for report generation
    - `JWT_KEY`: Secret key for JWT authentication

5. Run the application:

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```
